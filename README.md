# GoBujo

GoBujo is a journaling and productivity app that helps users create digital bullet journals (“BuJo”s). It also comes with a “Work” feature, in which users can join work rooms and have some company in completing their tasks for the day.    
  
Upon starting, the app will prompt you to either log in or create an account if you are a new user. The app will then display the Journals page, which also contains links to the Work and Settings pages. The Journals page displays all current bullet journals, along with the option to create a new journal. 
    
Clicking on a journal will bring up the journal’s contents in Viewing mode; you can press the “B” (back) and “F” (forward) buttons to navigate through the journal. To edit the contents, press the “Edit” button.  

Pressing the button will switch the journal to Editing mode, where you can change the text on the pages. You can also add a new page by pressing the “Add Page” button, which will create a blank page. To customize this blank page, press the “Spreads” button in the top left corner; this will pull up a selection of monthly spreads (templates for the beginning of a new month) and weekly spreads (weekly templates to plan out daily tasks). To add a spread, click and hold the desired template, then drag it onto the blank page. On a weekly spread, you can add a task for a certain day of the week by clicking “Add Task”.  
  
In Viewing mode, you can click on a task to mark it as complete; it will be grayed out.  
  
Aside from the main journaling feature, there is also the option to join work rooms. To do so, navigate back to the Journals page and click on “Work” in the top navigation bar. This will bring up a selection of existing work rooms, as well as the option to create a new work room. Clicking on one of the squares will take you into the room.  
  
Inside the room, there will be a chat, a list of other users in the room, and a layout titled “Today’s Tasks”. You have the option to connect a to-do list from one of your journals. To select your to-do list, click inside the layout, then choose your current journal and navigate to the page with your current tasks. Click on the day of the week that contains those tasks; you will then be brought back to the work room, and the tasks will be transferred over.  
  
Finally, in the Settings page, there is the option to edit your name and change your profile picture (by clicking on the picture). To save your changes, press “Update”.
